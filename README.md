# Monavara - The Purple Capybara of Monad 💜

Welcome to the official repository of Monavara, the legendary purple capybara of the Monad ecosystem.

## About Monavara

Monavara isn't just a coin. She's a movement. Born from a late-night call and a group of degens messing around on testnet, Monavara has become a symbol of reward, community, and unstoppable energy within the Monad ecosystem.
